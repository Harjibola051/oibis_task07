# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on credit card fraud detection using machine learning techniques. The analysis includes data exploration, feature engineering, and model training.

## Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and visualization
- Analyze feature distribution and correlations
- Build a machine learning model for fraud detection

## Dataset
- Source: CREDIT CARD DATA.xlsx.csv
- Key Features: Time, Amount, Class (Fraud or Non-Fraud), and other transaction attributes

## Tools and Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Key Analysis Steps

### 1. Data Exploration and Cleaning
- Checked for missing values
- Inspected unique values and data types
- Visualized class distribution with a count plot

### 2. Feature Distribution and Correlation Analysis
- Plotted distributions of numerical features
- Generated a heatmap to show feature correlations

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Removed irrelevant features (Time, Amount, and Class)
- Split data into input features and target variable

## Results
- Identified imbalanced class distribution
- Visualized key features contributing to fraud detection
- Prepared data for machine learning modeling



## Future Work
- Implement machine learning models for classification
- Conduct feature engineering for improved accuracy
